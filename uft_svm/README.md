Simple Virtual Machines and Language Translation.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In the repository, you'll find these directories:

  - `bin` holds compiled binaries and also scripts. 

  - `build` is a holding area for compiled files (`.o` and that ilk).
    IfÂ you are having trouble compiling, it is safe to remove
    everything from it and start over. (git ignored)

  - `src` contains sources that I provide and that you'll edit:

    - `src/svm` contains source code for the Simple Virtual Machine.
    - `src/uft` contains source code for the Universal Forward Translator.
