CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Matt Zhou

What work are you proud of?

  - proud of being able to run kn-vo and load the result into the svm

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I would like help improving my toreg and forEffect funcs

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - In codegen.sml line 62, I translate the funcode from kn to vs. I am 
  not sure if the way I translated the body of the funcode from a kn expression
  to a list of asm instructions is valid, though I don't really see other
  obvious ways to do this. The code I wrote to translate the expression is 
  essentially the big forEffect function, so, not sure if its right. 

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - all work original

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - Yes.
  - file knembed.sml line 33, pattern match on triple,  credit to vivian
  - file knembed.sml exp function (line 28), changed my name expressions 
  from S.lit to S.VAR, credit to kresten 


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - A quick look at toReg' and forEffect' would be nice, but also I am 
  interested in seeing how/what people came up with in their test cases. 

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - yes
