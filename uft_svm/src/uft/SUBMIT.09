CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Matt Zhou

What work are you proud of?

  - Proud of being able to translate fo -> vo

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I would like to imporve/find bugs in my nbRegsWith function and the
  translation of the DEFINE form

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - I would like the course staff to review the way I deal with function
  names in vmrun.c. 
  In the Call and Tailcall opcodes, I want to give the user the name of 
  the function that fails the arity check (the arity check occurs at line 188).
  I uses the 'funname' variable I get from lastglobalset as the name of the
  function. Is that an acceptable way of getting the name of the function?
  Alternatively, I think I could try and match the function value in 
  the global table and use that to index into the array that holds global_names,
  but i think using lastglobalset is aslo ok?

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - All code original 

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - Not a lot of changes


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I would like to see how people tackled translating the LET,
  FUNCALL, and DEFINE expressions.
  I am also interested in hearing about other people's debugging experience
  

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Yes
