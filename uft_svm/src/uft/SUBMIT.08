CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Matt Zhou

What work are you proud of?

  - proud of implementing arity checks

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I would like to review toReturn' and also dealing with funcall form 
    in forEffect' and toReg'

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - I think most material will be covered in the presentation, so no need this
  time. Thank you!

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - code original

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - Yes, in vmrun.c line 217. Initially, I passed topmost function in the 
  of the vm (i.e. the first ever functon) to lastglobalset. Thanks to Kresten,
  it is now switched to the current function. 


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I would like have a quick look at the toReturn function, but I am mostly
  interested in the presenter's test cases, how they came up with them and did 
  they find any bugs. Also, a look at how people dealt with the updated 
  'setglobal' projection would be nice too. 

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - Yes


P.S. the tests for this week's module are found in src/tests/m8tests/
