CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Matt Zhou

What work are you proud of?

  - I'm proud of writing/understanding some the asm parsers

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I would like some help improving the unparse function. In paticular, 
  I'm not too sure if the way I loaded the body of the function or the
  way that I indented the body is correct

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

    - A quick look at the parse_litnames function would be appreciated 
    (asmparse.sml line 98). This function is intented to help extract 
    object code literals from assembly. In paticular, I am not too sure about
    the error case of the function. If an invalid literal is given, the 
    whole parser would stop. I don't know if this behavior is acceptable or not

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - All code for this submission is original 

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - Was not present at code review 


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - Yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I would like to see the unparse function or how others dealt with literals
  and globals in assmebly  

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - I am willing to serve on the panel
