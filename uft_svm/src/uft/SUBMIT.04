CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Matt Zhou

What work are you proud of?

  - I am proud of making my translate and labelElim work (at least they seem to
  work ok to me)

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I would like some helping improving my labelElim function. It is quite
  convoluted right now and I would like to make it cleaner. 

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - I would like the course staff to take a quick look at my GRAMMAR in 
  /uft/vs_files. In paticular, global assignment (<globals> := <reg>). I'm 
  not sure if this is an okay way to set global values. Also, general feedback
  of the grammar would be appreciated as well!

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - worked on the lab portion of the assignment with Kresten.
  All other code original. 

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - Yes. I have made changes to the unparse function in file asmparse.sml 
  line 338. Specifically, the indenting of the function bodies. This change
  is attributed to Roger and Stephanie.
  - Also changes to the literal parser in asmparse.sml line 98. The function
  now returns NONE when encountering an input it can't parse. This change is
  attributed to nr.


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - I would like to be in the audience this time.

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I would like to see how people cleaned up their parsers, and also 
  the translate function. I think I would learn the most from seeing how
  others used monads to propagate errors and transalte instructions in their
  translate / labelElim function.  

Again supposing you are not selected to present, who in your group is
willing to serve on the review panel?

  - I would like to be in the audience this time.
