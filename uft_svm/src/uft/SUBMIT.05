CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Matt Zhou

What work are you proud of?

  - Proud of somewhat understanding the function comps in uft.sml 

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I would like to improve my exp function in knProject.sml, in paticular, 
  I want to get better error msgs out of the function

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - I would like the course staff to review my exp helper function in 
  knembed.sml. In paticular, I am not exactly sure if the way I handled the 
  VMPOL form is acceptable - in the "setglobal" case, alist should just contain
  one element, but I'm not sure if the way i extract the element is ok; In 
  the general apply case, I tag the literal to the end of the list with @,
  maybe there are better way of doing this?

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - All code original

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - assembler.sml line 61, mondaic lift, credit to vivian 


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I would like to see the embedding of kn expressions to VScheme defs be
  presented

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - yes
