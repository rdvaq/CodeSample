CS 106 Homework Submission

What person or group is submitting this homework?

  - Matt Zhou

What work are you proud of?

  - Proud of having an understanding of the from-to space concept

What code would you like help improving?  Are there bugs you'd like
help finding during code review?

  - I would like to improve my vmrun function, specifically the where/how
  I call the gc. I'm a bit shaky about my call to gc in the goto op and want
  to check that with others. 

What code, if any, would you especially like the course staff to
review?  Why?

  - I would like the course staff to review Line 131 - 135 of vmrun.c.
  The code implements the Cons operation.
  A new block is allocated on the vmheap and then populated with 
  the appropriate values. Since the code does reference a heap-allocated
  payload, I wrap the references with GCVALIDATE. However, since it is
  not possible that the gc will run between the allocation and reference,
  I'm not sure if it is necessary to perform this check.
  Thank you! 

In this course, all code may be shared freely.  Aside from code that
is distributed with the assignment, does your submission contain any
other code that you got from someone else?  If so, what code is it
(file names and line numbers please) and who supplied it?

  - All code original

In response to last week's code review, have you made any material
changes?  What were they?  By file name and line number, where are
they found in the code?  If you remember, who helped you during code
review?

  - No changes


We have a plenary code review tomorrow.  Are you willing to present
(as a group, if applicable)?

  - yes

Supposing you are not selected to present at tomorrow's plenary code
review, what code would you like to see presented?  What would you
learn the most from?

  - I would like to see the how people generally implemented the gc function,
  and how they maintained the register invariant would be helpful. I'm not
  too confident in my memset math...
  A look at vm run for when the gc is called would also be helpful

Again supposing you are not selected to present, are you willing to
serve on the review panel? (Or if there are more than one of you, who
is willing to serve?)

  - yes


Side note:

I have implemented the depth point from module 10 number 14.
The changes and implementation of the depth point is documented in 
src/dps/m10-14/README, along with the test cases.
