Acknowledgments: 
    Went to office hours for various bugs and clarifying questions. 
    Discussed general ideas about the homework with classmates.
Implementation:
    To our knowledge, 
    UArray2 and Bit2 has been implemented correctly with the desired 
    functionalities; 
    
    Sudoku is able to check if a given sudoku solution is valid or not;
      -sudoku.c uses the validCheck.h interface to check if a given solution is valid
      -validCheck.c is implemented using uarray2.h
         
    Unblackedges is able to remove all black pixels connected to the 
    black pixels at the edge of image
      -unblackedges.c uses the white.h interface
      -white.c is implemented using bit2.h
