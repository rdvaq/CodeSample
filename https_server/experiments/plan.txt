All times in s 

improvement: 

= 100 * ((server time) - (proxy time))/(server time)

Experiment 1: 

Start proxy with unused sockets = 0

Have client connect to mcafee main site
Have it connect to 10 resources on the same host 

Start proxy with unused sockets = 10 

Repeat above 

css = close server sockets
suss = save unused server sockets

Experiment 2: 

curl a variety of resources
have client maintain connection (c program)

Keeping connection open to client when both client and proxy are on same machine may not improve time too much
Similar amount of time in making connections from proxy -> server as curl has to from client -> server (again proxy machine = client machine)

Experiment 3:

curl mcafee index with server 15 times 
curl 10 mcafee resources (besides index) via proxy and cache them then curl mcafee index 
repeat this 5 times 
curl 20 mcafee resources (besides index) via proxy and cache them then curl mcafee index 
repeat this 5 times 
curl 40 mcafee resources (besides index) via proxy and cache them then curl mcafee index 
repeat this 5 times 

Saw that the number of modifications does not greatly increase response time nor does the process of making modifications based on entries in the cache
does not cause a great time delay compared to server 

Experiment 4: 

tunnel through proxy for top 10 alexa urls that i recognize, taken from here: 
https://www.htmlstrip.com/alexa-top-1000-most-visited-websites

Experiment 5: 

show increase cache size and doing searches has little impact 
cache hits less than 1/100 th of a second regardless of size (time so low probably because on same machine, but hash table working properly)
cache misses vary around 1/100 th of a second regardless of size 
cache misses differ from server requests of the same resources by around 1/100 th of a second over varying sizes

Experiment 6: 

show increase banned lists should have no impact

It does not regardless of the size of banlist (hash table working as expected)

Experiment 7: 

show that enforcing rate limiting has no impact 

it does not have an impact (3 resources tested)
